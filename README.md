## Used technologies

```
Technologies used in the project;

1- vscode

2- Golang

3- Golang fiber library for APIs

4- httptest library for Golang tests

5- sqlite as database to store data

6- Postman to test API

7- Flow chart for drawing the project chart and ease of visual understanding

```
## Running the tests

```
_test.go tests were written for the files with the .go extension in the repository. 
You can run and check the tests by going to the appropriate file location with the 
'go test -v' command or by opening the _test.go file and clicking the play button 
next to the functions.

```

### And coding style tests

```
There are two kinds of test algorithms in the _test.go files in the repository. 
1 for Get requests. 2. Test algorithms for Post requests. httptest library is 
used for these test algorithms.

```


## Deployment

```
You can make the project live by creating a subscription with heroku, which 
I like in terms of interface and usage, or you can do the same by creating 
a container with docker.

```
## Build With

```
Specify OS or Architecture in build:
env GOOS=linux go build main.go # builds for Linux
env GOARCH=arm go build main.go # builds for ARM architecture

Build multiple files:
go build main.go assets.go # outputs an executable: main

Building a package:
go build . # outputs an executable with name as the name of enclosing folder

```
